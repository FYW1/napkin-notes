## SGD-based SPARFA

Drew and I worked out
some of the potential CLUE issues
mentioned last week.

Below are plots
of CLUE vs time
(well, number of questions answered)
for a handful of learners
on a handful of topics.
Each plot shows
questions answered by one learner
on one concept.
(The ids are anonymized
and the chronology of the answers is arbitrary.)
The calculations were run five times
to give a feel for the variation incurred 
when SPARFA recomputes the matrices.

By my eye,
it seems that we are still over-estimating
the variation in the CLUE.
There are a few things that could potentially improve on this,
but it will take some experimentation to validate them.

We fixed a known issue in the CLUE calculations.
As a result, 
the CLUE intervals
are likely more asymmetric
than previously seen.
If this continues to be the case
after adjustments are made,
we should try to ensure
that whatever display we use
can convey CLUE information
adequately and accurately
to the learners.
