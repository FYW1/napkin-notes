## SGD-based SPARFA

The CLUE calculations are fully implemented,
but there are some potential issues
for me and Drew to work out.

Basically, there is a tradeoff
between allowing SPARFA to learn about question concepts
and the size of the CLUE intervals.
We could parly compensate for this
by using my proposed CLUE display
(or some variant of it).
The resulting CLUE intervals
are also more asymmetric
than we have previously observed
(partly due to how the research code calculations were performed).

It is promising, though,
that the intervals are reasonably consistent
across imputation runs.
