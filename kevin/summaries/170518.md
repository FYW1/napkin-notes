## Biglearn Deployment

`BL API`, `BL Scheduler`, and `BL Local Query` 
are all up and running in `-dev`.  
There is one performance issue on `Tutor` 
related to applying sequence numbers to large transactions
which Dante is currently addressing.
We have also made some minor tweaks to the internal APIs,
but basically things are working as expected.

Mike A. and I 
have been working on the `BL Sparfa` server.
We have written python code 
to pull data from `BL API` and `BL Scheduler`
and inspect its contents.
Mike is working on automating these tools
and storing the data in the local database.

## SGD-based SPARFA

I'm finishing up the last of the TeSR code this week,
which is responsible to ranking questions
that are used for SPEs and PEs.
