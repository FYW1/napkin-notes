# CNX APIs

https://cnx.org APIs are split into 4 areas and documented in greater detail in each repository.

You can retrieve published content using the [^cnx-archive] APIs (including search), and can change content using the [^cnx-publishing-api] APIs.

Browser URLs are managed and documented in [^webview].

## Identifiers

There are 4 types of identifiers used within https://cnx.org

- sha hash
- UUID
- Short UUID
- UUID and version

### Sha hash

These are used for identifying resources (ie images) and the hash is a hash of the bits in the resource file.


### UUID

This is an identifier created either by the author or automatically by the Databse when publishing a new [Book](#book) or [Page](#page).


### Short UUID

This is a computed string which is based on the first few bits of the UUID.

It is used to reduce the length of URLs to a [Book](#book), [Page](#page), or eventually a Unit/Chapter.

### UUID and version

A specific version of a [Book](#book) or [Page](#page) is identified by a `{UUID}@{VERSION}` string.

- Page Version: the version is a natural number (`@123`) and increments when a Page is published (either content or metadata changes)
- Book Version: the version is 2 numbers, `@{MAJOR}.{MINOR}`
  - the `{MINOR}` number increments when a Page in the book changes
  - the `{MAJOR}` number increments when the Book structure (adding/removing Pages or Chapters) or Book metadata changes


## Types

Content in cnx generally falls into 3 types:

- Resource
- Page
- Book
- Special

### Resource

A Resource is typically an image that is included as part of a [Page](#page). It is referenced in a [Page](#page) as `<img src="../resources/${SHA}/${OPTIONAL_FRIENDLY_NAME}">` in the HTML contents.

It is identified by a hash of its contents and may contain an optional filename.

A consequence of using a hash is that Resources are replaced but never changed.


Examples:

- https://cnx.org/resources/d47864c2ac77d80b1f2ff4c4c7f1b2059669e3e9
- https://cnx.org/resources/d47864c2ac77d80b1f2ff4c4c7f1b2059669e3e9/Figure_01_00_01.jpg

Resources are static and do not change. In order to replace an image, one has to edit the [Page](#page) and change the `<img src="..."/>` tag.


### Page

A Page is the content of a book. It is smaller than a Chapter, typically a Book Section.

A Page is identified by a UUID, a version, and an optional [Book](#book) UUID.

There are several variations of retrieving a Page but the URL format uses the following pattern:

`https://archive.cnx.org/contents/{OPT_BOOK_IDENTIFIER:}{IDENTIFIER}{OPT_EXTENSION}`

- `OPT_BOOK_IDENTIFIER` can be a [UUID](#uuid) or a [short UUID](#short-uuid) and may contain an optional `@{MAJOR_VERSION}.{MINOR_VERSION}` which indicates a particular version of the [Book](#book) this Page is in
  - Why include the [Book](#book) identifier?
    - typically numbering elements like Figures or Exercises are dependent on which Book this Page is in
- `IDENTIFIER` can be a [UUID](#uuid) or a [short UUID](#short-uuid) and may contain an optional `@{MAJOR_VERSION}` which indicates a particular version of the Page
- `OPT_EXTENSION` indicates which format should be returned. Valid values are `.html` or `.json`
  - If an extension is not provided, the `Accept:` header is used to determine which format to return.


Examples:

- https://archive.cnx.org/contents/1d1fd537-77fb-4eac-8a8a-60bbaa747b6d
- https://archive.cnx.org/contents/1d1fd537-77fb-4eac-8a8a-60bbaa747b6d.html
- https://archive.cnx.org/contents/1d1fd537-77fb-4eac-8a8a-60bbaa747b6d.json
- https://archive.cnx.org/contents/1d1fd537-77fb-4eac-8a8a-60bbaa747b6d@3.html
- https://archive.cnx.org/contents/HR_VN3f7.html
- https://archive.cnx.org/contents/HR_VN3f7.json
- https://archive.cnx.org/contents/Ax2o07Ul:HR_VN3f7.html
- https://archive.cnx.org/contents/Ax2o07Ul:HR_VN3f7

And in the browser:

- https://cnx.org/contents/1d1fd537-77fb-4eac-8a8a-60bbaa747b6d
- https://cnx.org/contents/1d1fd537-77fb-4eac-8a8a-60bbaa747b6d@3
- https://cnx.org/contents/HR_VN3f7
- https://cnx.org/contents/HR_VN3f7@3
- https://cnx.org/contents/Ax2o07Ul@9.74:HR_VN3f7@3
- https://cnx.org/contents/031da8d3-b525-429c-80cf-6c8ed997733a@9.74:1d1fd537-77fb-4eac-8a8a-60bbaa747b6d


### Book

https://cnx.org/contents/031da8d3-b525-429c-80cf-6c8ed997733a

A Book is a tree which closely resembles the Table of Contents.

- Leaf nodes **must** be [Page](#page)s
  - These Pages end up being rendered as Preface, Chapter Sections, and Appendixes
- Non-Leaf nodes end up being Units or Chapters, depending on the depth of the node

Example Book structure:

```
Physics Book
- Preface (Page 1)
- Unit 1
  - Chapter 1
    - Section 1.1 (Page 2)
    - Section 1.2 (Page 3)
  - Chapter 2
    - Section 2.1 (Page 4)
    - Section 2.2 (Page 5)
- Appendix A (Page 6)
- Appendix B (Page 7)
```


## Retrieving Content

Book content can be retrieved by:

- Manually finding the book on https://cnx.org
- Using the Search API

Then, to retrieve the entire book, remove the Page ID in the URL and change the hostname from `cnx.org` to `archive.cnx.org`.

As an example, https://cnx.org/contents/Ax2o07Ul@9.74:HR_VN3f7@3/Introduction-to-Science-and-th becomes https://archive.cnx.org/contents/Ax2o07Ul@9.74


### Individual Books and Pages



### Search


### Redirects

To handle the case of short UUIDs and optional version numbers several server redirects happen. To illustrate, we will use the following example:

1. Browser requests [https://cnx.org/contents/{UUID}](https://cnx.org/contents/031da8d3-b525-429c-80cf-6c8ed997733a)
1. JavaScript requests [https://archive.cnx.org/contents/{UUID}](https://archive.cnx.org/contents/031da8d3-b525-429c-80cf-6c8ed997733a)
1. server redirects to [https://archive.cnx.org/contents/{UUID}@{VERSION}](https://archive.cnx.org/contents/031da8d3-b525-429c-80cf-6c8ed997733a@9.74)
1. AJAX response contains the short UUID for the Book (`Ax2o07Ul`) and the Preface Page (`HR_VN3f7@3`)
1. JavaScript requests the Preface Page with the book ID to get the correct context
1. JavaScript changes the browser URL to [https://cnx.org/contents/{BOOK_SHORT_ID}@{VER}:{PAGE_SHORT_ID}@{VER}}/{TITLE_SLUG}](https://cnx.org/contents/Ax2o07Ul@9.74:HR_VN3f7@3/Introduction-to-Science-and-th)


## Publishing Content

Publishing content requires POSTing a specially-formatted ePUB as a payload.

This payload contains all the Books (usually 1), Pages, Resources, and metadata (like permissions).

See the [^cnx-publishing-api] for more details on the format and URLs.
